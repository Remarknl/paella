# Learnings

* Regular supermarket doesn't carry half the ingredients
* The whole seafood thing is true
* Too much ingredients for a 28cm pan and thus too high
* Stay with it while cooking or it might get "crunchy"
* Time to get some real ingredients

# Tasting
* Looks OK
* Make sure to let it cool down before sticking it into your mouth
* Tastes ok, boring spices. Chorizo fixes this bit.
* Sticky rice
* Ratio's are good





Time to up the game...
